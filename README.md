# Continual Learning
This is a PyTorch implementation of the continual learning experiments described in the following paper:
* [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06494](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06494)

## Project proposal
[https://www.overleaf.com/read/cghtkvkvhmnj](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cghtkvkvhmnj)

## Project goals
* implement prior-, likelihood-focused and hybrid continual learning approaches, in particular VCL, VGR and VCL+coresets models
* test models on MNIST based datasets such as permuted MNIST, split MNIST
* compare results

## Team members
* Alexey Topolnitskiy
* Vladislav Goncharenko
* Alsu Sagirova

## Running the experiments
* VCL experiment is placed in notebook BMML_Project_VCL_v7.ipynb
* DGR implementation and experiment is placed in Full_VGR (5).ipynb
