# Continual Learning
This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of the continual learning experiments described in the following paper:
* [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06494](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06494)

## Project proposal
[https://www.overleaf.com/read/cghtkvkvhmnj](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cghtkvkvhmnj)

## Project goals
* implement prior- and likelihood-focused continual learning approaches, in particular VCL+coresets and  VGR models
* test models permuted MNIST, split MNIST
* compare results

## Team members
* Alexey Topolnitskiy
* Alsu Sagirova

## Requirements
To install all required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the experiments
To run the experiments you can use IPython notebooks from the _notebooks_ folder
